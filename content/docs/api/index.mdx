description: How to interact with the dokploy API for administrators and users
---

In some cases, you may need to interact directly with the dokploy API. Here's how both administrators and users can do this.

## For Administrators

1. Access the Swagger UI by navigating to `your-vps-ip:3000/swagger`.
2. Use the Swagger interface to interact with the API.
3. By default, access to the Swagger UI is restricted, and only authenticated administrators can access the API.

## For Users

1. By default, users do not have direct access to the API.
2. Administrators can grant users access to:
   - Generate access tokens
   - Access the Swagger UI
3. If you need access, contact your administrator.

Note: The API provides advanced functionalities. Make sure you understand the operations you're performing to avoid unintended changes to the system.
